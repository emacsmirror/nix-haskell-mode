* nix-haskell-mode

nix-haskell-mode is an easy way to get Haskell projects set up in
Emacs. It uses haskell-modeâ€™s interactive-haskell-mode to provide
integration with Emacs. Nix is used to pull in dependencies of each
Cabal file.

To use with use-package, just add this to your configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package nix-haskell-mode
  :hook (haskell-mode . nix-haskell-mode))
#+END_SRC
